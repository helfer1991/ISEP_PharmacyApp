# ISEP_PharmacyApp
 * Application that aims to recreate a system to manage pharmacies and their stocks (for example, if a given pharmacy was short of stock of some product, the system allowed the Admin to execute transfers between pharmacies). Furthermore, each pharmacy could send orders to clients.
 * The orders are to be sent either through a scooter or a drone, dependending on the location of both the pharmacy and the client. The criteria to choose between a scooter and a drone was the amount of energy spent on the course. A Floyd algorithm was employed to help calculate the shortest path between the 2 addresses.
 * This application was created on the context of LAPR3 course unit of ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto). The final grade was 18/20. 
 * I was part of a team of 6 people and each one of us had their use cases and was responsible for the full development cycle, as in, everything related with the documentation (including the E-R Model), implementation and testing.
 * Technologies used: Java, JavaFX, C, Assembly, SQL, Jenkins and SonarQube.
